# Delicious Food Recipes
## A React Recipe-Tracking App

![Main page showing table of recipes and add recipe form.](./main.png)

A front-end-only CRUD application to display, add, and delete recipes.

Recipes added via the "Create" form will append to the table between the final existing recipe and the form.

*Note: This application does not use a database or API to store data - it is intended as a demonstration of the React useState() hook*
